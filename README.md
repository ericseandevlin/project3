TimeCapsule is a CRUD app that allows users to register an account, respond to questions, and save responses into a time capsule. The user can view his or her saved time capsules, but not make changes to them - that's not how time capsules work! Instead, the CRUD functionality requirement is satisfied by the user's ability to make changes to his or her account information, or delete the account altogether.

In addition to the time capsules, users have the option to save their age and location, adding value to the APIs created by including demographic data with the question-and-answer sets that make up the time capsules.
